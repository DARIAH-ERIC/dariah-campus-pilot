### Contributing to DARIAH-CAMPUS

#### First-time contribution

1. **In GitHub Desktop, create a new branch off of master.**
   Call it by your name, then go watch the movie "Call me by your name" if you haven't seen it already.
2. **Do your work.**
3. **Commit your work.**
   This will save your initial work to _your_ branch _locally_.
4. **Publish your branch.**
   This will save your intial work to _your_ branch _remotely_.
5. **Create a pull request.**
   This will alert the repository admin person that there are changes that should be merged into the master branch, i.e. made public.

#### Subsequent contributions

Before you make your next contribution, you have to make sure that your local branch is up to date. Remember, you created your special little branch off of master at some point, but other people may have contributed to master in the meantime. So it's very important that you follow  this procedure _every time_ you start doing work on your branch again.

1. **In GitHub Desktop, in your branch, fetch origin.**
   This will check whether there were any changes made to _your_ branch _remotely_.
2. **If GitHub Desktop instructs you to pull origin, pull origin.**
   This will make sure that _your local_ and _your remote branch_ are in sync. Which is important, if you have, for instance, used a different computer to commit and publish etc. Or if, God forbid, somebody messed around with your branch. They shouldn't. But it did happen at least once. And Toma was to blame :)
3. **Branch > Update from master**
   This will now, in addition, update _your local branch_ with all the contributions that have meanwhile been merged into the master from the other branches. Remember, each contributor works in their own branch.
4. **Do your work.**
5. **Commit your work.**    
   This will save your work to _your_ branch _locally_.
6. **Push origin.**    
   This will save your work to _your_ branch _remotely_.
7. **Create a pull request.**    
   This will alert the repository admin person that there are changes that should be merged into the master branch, i.e. made public.
