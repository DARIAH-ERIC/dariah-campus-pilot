In addition to being powered by an enthusiasm for research infrastructures and an awareness of the importance of training and education for building sustainable RIs, DARIAH-CAMPUS is a Jekyll-powered static website hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus).

More extensive documentation will be forthcoming.
