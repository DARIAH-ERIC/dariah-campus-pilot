DARIAH-Campus is a pilot project exploring different ways of capturing and consolidating DARIAH learning resources. It is being developed in the context of a H2020-funded project [DESIR](https://www.dariah.eu/activities/projects-and-affiliations/desir/).

Being a pilot project, DESIR-CAMPUS is not yet ready for an official release. We will be evaluating the project in the coming months and make a decision on how to proceed.
