This video features Geoffrey Rockwell, Professor of Philosophy and Humanities Computing at the University of Alberta, Canada and Stéfan Sinclair, Associate Professor of Digital Humanities at McGill University.  Their discussion involves text visualisation within Digital Humanities, thus emphasising, that visualisation is not the end product, but an intellectual process of thinking and interpreting text. Interactive visualisations, uses of visualisation for narrative, physical computing, video games, and Pokemon Go are also discussed.
