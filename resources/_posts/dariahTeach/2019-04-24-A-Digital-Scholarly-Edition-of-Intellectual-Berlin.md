This video features Anne Baillot (Centre Marc Bloch, Berlin) talking about the Digital Edition 'Letters and Texts: Intellectual Berlin around 1800'. This online digital edition presents texts from 1800 to 1830 that were, until this day, either completely unpublished or published in an abridged form. This work is funded by the German Research Foundation.
