    <p><em>Persistent identifiers.</em></p>
    <p>The proliferation of datasets and services available online invites researchers to link them from their works. A link to a service, that makes it possible to explore the data in question yourself, might be more valuable than a picture. But these types of online resources and/or the infrastructures they live in are constantly evolving. Which effectively leads to dead links or links to a different version of the resource. PID systems can help with keeping the locations of resources up to date as well as store information about what the resource is.</p>

    <h2 class="h2 h2--counter">Canonical Text Services: Matthew Munson &amp; Christopher Blackwell</h2>

    <h3 class="h3">Abstract</h3>

    <p><em>Canonical Text Services.</em></p>
    <p>Canonical Text Services (CTS) is a protocol for identification and retrieval of passages of text by means of machine-actionable citations in URN form. CTS is not bibliographic database or commentary framework, but a protocol intended to serve use-cases like those. CTS consists of a specification for URN citations, and a specification for a service-protocol. CTS was created for the Homer Multitext to address that project’s need to integrate (a) an open-ended diversity of texts, (b) many specific versions of the same text, some digital, some in print, and some in manuscript, many fragmentary, (c) at arbitrary levels of abstraction (“Iliad Book 2”) or specificity (“The third letter sigma at Iliad 1.2 on the Venetus A manuscript”), (d) with the assumption that technologies for storage, retrieval, and display will change completely during the project’s lifetime. This presentation will introduce CTS as a possible model for persistent identifiers in a large-scale, distributed digital library. The first part of the presentation will offer an overview of the protocol, the CTS URN citation scheme, and the CTS Service requests, with attention to applications and limitations of CTS. The second part will present how the Open Greek and Latin project of the University of Leipzig is implementing CTS and the tools it is making available for editors, publishers, and consumers of CTS texts.</p>

              <p>Matthew Munson received an MA from the University of Virginia in Religious Studies, his thesis studying the use of the Greek word for law (νόμος) in the letters of the Apostle Paul. Before joining the Digital Humanities Team, he worked at the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia and in the DARIAH project at the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities at the University of Göttingen, Germany. He is currently working on his PhD in Theology in Leipzig studying the automatic extraction of semantic data from biblical texts and the automatic tracking of semantic drift between corpora.</p>
