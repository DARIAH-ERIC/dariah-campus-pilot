abstract: "DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about the role of training and education in digital research infrastructures."
# Abstract is the text which appears as a teaser on the resources pages, i.e. https://dariah-eric.github.io/dariah-campus/resources/. It should be shortish. The text that appears in the body of the post (below) can be longer and split into paragraphs if necessary.
# List videos as below

    # Screenshot from the actual video. If it's a frame of the speaker, try to find one where the speaker looks nice and is at least not making weird faces :)
    # To create screenshots I found it easy with the Firefox extension https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-screenshot-button/. After you install it, you can move through the video and once you find the frame you like, simply click on the screenshot button. No need for sizing the screenshot yourself.
    desc: Former DARIAH Director
    #desc: "Some description, for instance about the speaker or the content of the video"
    # desc will appear in smaller gray letters below the video title. On single-video resources there is usually no need to use, because the information is already contained in the title and the actual post (below). On multiple-video resources, the desc field can be used to distinguish multiple videos or add information about each speaker.

columns: 2
# by default, videos are displayed in big boxes, one after another, after the text of the post. For multiple videos, use two columns.
width: small
# if columns = 2, please add width: small. counter-intuitively, this makes the body of the post wider (default is xsmall) so that two-columns videos are less squished.

DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
